This library contains different processes that inter-connect fundamental REST libraries, requiring to transfer an event type into another. I.e. hit clustering to transform detector hits into a track event, or raw signal to be transformed into a detector event. It also may contain other complex processes that require to use 2 libraries simultaneously.

Please have a look to this library [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before pushing changes to this repository.
